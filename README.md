# automatescripty

Aren't you guys tired of updating firmare and stuff individually all the time, and even with all the automatic updates, few of things (firmware and security) seems to be just be out of place right? Guess what! I HATE THAT problem too and so for you guys, you getting your linux system's a big automater script thingy. 

Well I am making this script for linux distributions in hopes of one to use them to automate their updates-upgrades for system, firmware, flatpak, snapd, python3, python3-pip, nodejs, etc. Also checking for security, looking for leaks and getting an overview of your entire system.

These Linux distributions include: Arch, Debian, Fedora. (The big 3 lol) Hence 3 scripts for each. Yes you can automate these scripts to run everyday at a particular time installing and using Cronie or cron, but in this I shall only provide you guys the script to use!

On the basis of these distributions (if you tend to use any subdistros of these, you can run the program that I provide)

Also please do comment and help me out of there is some problem with the scripts that I provide. I would love honest and clear feedback for this work.
