# automatescripty
Well I am making this script for linux distributions in hopes of one to use them to automate their updates-upgrades for system, firmware, flatpak, snapd, python3, python3-pip, nodejs, etc. Also checking for security, looking for leaks and getting an overview of your entire system.
