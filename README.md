# automatescripty
Well I am making this script for linux distributions in hopes of one to use them to automate their updates-upgrades for system, firmware, flatpak, snapd, python3, python3-pip, nodejs, etc. Also checking for security, looking for leaks and getting an overview of your entire system.

These Linux distributions include: Arch, Debian, Fedora. (The big 3 lol) Hence 3 scripts for each. 
On the basis of these distributions (if you tend to use any subdistros of these, you can run the program that I provide)

Also please do comment and help me out of there is some problem with the scripts that I provide. I would love honest and clear feedback for this work.
